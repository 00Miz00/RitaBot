## Prefix and Commands

The bot's default prefix is !t (or !translate) - All commands must start with this prefix for the bot to process them.

### Important Notes

* Users who wish to receive automatic translations in private must **enable DMs** via **server privacy settings**.

* Bot must have proper permissions in all relevant channels for full functionality (read, write, react, mention, attachments, embed).

### Command structure

```bash
[prefix] + [main command] + [parameters]
```

For Example:

```
`!translate` `help` `custom`
```

`!t` `help` `custom`

`@Translator` `help` `custom`

### Get help inside Discord

### Requesting features or reporting bugs
