## Prefix and Commands

The bot's default prefix is !t (or !translate) - All commands must start with this prefix for the bot to process them.

### Important Notes

* Users who wish to receive automatic translations in private must **enable DMs** via **server privacy settings**.

* Bot must have proper permissions in all relevant channels for full functionality (**read**, **write**, **react**, **mention**, **attachments**, **embed**).

### Command structure

```bash
[prefix] + [main command] + [parameters]
```

For Example:

```bash
!translate help misc
```
or
```bash
!t help misc
```
or
```bash
@Translator help misc
```

### Get help inside Discord

Use this command within any channel the bot has permissions
```bash
!translate help
``` 
or mention the bot like so 
```bash
@Translator
```
